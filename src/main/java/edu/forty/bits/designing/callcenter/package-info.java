/*
 *Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager and director.
 * An incoming telephone call must be first to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call,
 * he or she must escalate the call to manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call
 * should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method
 * dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.
